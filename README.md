# Expense Tracker 💰

## About This Project
This is a simple command-line Expense Tracker built using Python. The goal of this project was to practice handling file operations, user input, and object-oriented programming (OOP) while building a useful budgeting tool.

## Features 🚀
- Allows users to input expenses with name, amount, and category.
- Saves expenses to a CSV file (`expenses.csv`).
- Reads the expense file and summarizes expenses by category.
- Calculates total expenses and remaining budget.
- Saves the remaining budget to a separate file (`budget.txt`).

## How to Run 🏃‍♂️
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/expense-tracker.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd expense-tracker
   ```
3. Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3 recommended).
4. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Learning Outcomes 📚
Through this project, I have improved my understanding of:
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) with classes.
- File handling (reading and writing data to files).
- Using dictionaries and lists for data storage.
- Handling user input and validation.
- Error handling and debugging.

## Future Improvements 🔧
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter.
- Add a feature to edit or delete past expenses.
- Provide visual charts for expense analysis.
- Store expenses in a database for better data management.
